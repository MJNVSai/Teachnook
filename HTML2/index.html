    <p> <b> <i> The z-test is also a hypothesis test in which the z-statistic follows a normal distribution. </i> </b>
        The z-test is best used for greater-than-30 samples because, <br> under the central limit theorem,
        as the number of samples gets larger, <br> the samples are considered to be approximately normally distributed.
        <b> When conducting a z-test, the null and alternative hypotheses, alpha and z-score should be stated. </b> Next,
        Test statistic should be calculated, and the results and conclusion stated. A z-statistic, or z-score,
        is a number representing how many standard deviations above or below the mean population a score derived from a z-test is.
        <i> Examples of tests that can be conducted as z-tests include a one-sample location test, a two-sample location test,
            a paired difference test, and a maximum likelihood estimate. </i> Z-tests are closely related to t-tests, but
        t-tests are best performed when an experiment has a small sample size. Also, t-tests assume that
        the standard deviation is unknown, while z-tests assume it is known. If the standard deviation of
        the population is unknown, the assumption of the sample variance equaling the population variance is made. </p>
